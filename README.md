# HW1
Program made to show which funtion is faster 
Adding two floats or two doubles
By creating arrays to preform the addtions and calcualte the elapsed time for each function.

Part 2 I chose computing the square of a double via direct substitution, or computing the square using the built in function Math.Pow function.
Also coming these to the built-in square root function: Math.Sqrt.function
For this one I made an array of random doubles, computed the square of each via direct multiplication using Math.pow and compute the square root using Math.sqrt
Measure the time taken for each operation and provide the ratios for comparison

When I ran the code it showed that doubles added faster for the first one and using the Math.sqrt was faster
